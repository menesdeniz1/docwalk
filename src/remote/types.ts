/**
 * Remote control and followers (decision 8, moved into v1 on 2026-11-05).
 *
 * A presenter opens a room; phones join as remotes, other devices as
 * followers, by QR code or link: `<origin>/?view=remote#room=<id>&k=<key>` or
 * `?view=follow#room=<id>&v=<key>&p=<state key>`. The keys never reach the server: they live
 * in the URL fragment. The control key (`k`) steers the deck and reads and
 * writes the document; the view key (`v`) only follows (decision 68). Every
 * frame on the wire is an `EncryptedFrame`; the
 * relay (worker/) only forwards bytes. The document itself is never sent:
 * followers load it from the share link (`?src=`, `?repo=` or `#doc=`), which
 * the presenter includes in its `hello`.
 *
 * The presenter also mirrors its laser, pen marks and diagram focus view to
 * followers (decision 88): `mirror` messages, signed like `state`.
 *
 * Agents (decision 59) are the exception: a local MCP server (`mcp/`) joins
 * with a room's link and asks the presenter for the document, the slide list,
 * or a document write. Those messages are addressed (`from` on a request,
 * `to` on its answer) and can be larger than a relay frame, so they travel as
 * encrypted `part`s (src/remote/parts.ts). The presenter applies a write only
 * while "Allow agent edits" is on.

/**
 * One participant's connection to a remote-control room (decision 8). The
 * relay forwards frames to every other socket in the room; this client
 * encrypts what it sends, decrypts and validates what it receives, and
 * reconnects on its own. Navigation events are ephemeral: nothing is queued
 * while the socket is down. Instead, remotes and followers send `hello` on
 * every (re)connect and the presenter answers with its current state.
 *
 * Keys by role (decision 68): the presenter holds both, remotes and agents
 * the control key, followers the view key. Everything is sent under the
 * control key except a follower's hello (view key) and the presenter's
 * state, which goes out under both so followers and remotes each get it.
 * The presenter accepts nothing under the view key but a follower's hello,
 * so a follow link can neither steer the deck nor talk to agents. Every
 * frame is sealed with this connection's id and counter, and a frame whose
 * counter a receiver has seen from that sender is dropped (replay.ts).
 *
 * Followers share the view key, so it cannot tell them apart from the
 * presenter. The presenter signs every state it sends with the room's
 * private state key, and a follower takes nothing but state that verifies
 * under the public key from its link (decision 73).
 *
 * The client runs in Node too (the `docwalk-mcp` agent, decision 59), so it
 * uses no DOM API beyond what Node 22 also has.
